Diabetes Risk Assessment with Machine Learning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Diabetes Risk Assessment with Machine Learning" project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the risk of diabetes using machine learning techniques implemented in Python.

Project Overview:

Diabetes is a critical health issue affecting millions worldwide. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of diabetes based on certain input features such as age, body mass index (BMI), glucose levels, and more. By harnessing the power of data analysis and predictive modelling, this project seeks to provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and preventive care.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Models: Explore various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression to predict diabetes risk.
Data Preprocessing: Learn how to handle missing data, normalize features, and prepare the dataset for training and evaluation.
Model Evaluation: Understand how to assess the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interactive Jupyter Notebooks: Dive into our Jupyter notebooks for a step-by-step walkthrough of the project pipeline.
Data Visualization: Visualize key relationships and insights in the data to aid in feature selection and interpretation.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the notebooks folder to access the Jupyter notebooks.
Follow the instructions in the notebooks to understand the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.
Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to enhance your understanding.
